    "At this point we know how to build models and have a computer automatically learn how to match the model to data. That is the core of how any machine learning method works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's narrow our focus and look at **neural nets**. Neural nets are a specific choice of a **model**. It's a network of **neurons** which begs the question, what is a neuron?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models with multiple inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have been using the sigmoid function as our model. One of the forms of the sigmoid function we've used is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_{w, b}(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-wx + b)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where `x` and `w` are both single numbers. We have been using this function to model how the amount of the color green in an image (`x`) can be used to determine if an image shows an apple or a banana. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we had multiple data features we wanted to fit? \n",
    "\n",
    "We could then extend our model to include multiple features like\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_{\\mathbf{w},b}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-w_1 x_1 - w_2 x_2 - \\ldots - w_n x_n + b)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that now $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ are vectors with many components rather than a number. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $x_1$ might be the amount of the color green in an image, $x_2$ could be the height of the object in the picture, $x_3$ could be the width, and so forth. We can add information for as many features as we have! Our model now has more parameters, but the same idea of gradient descent (\"rolling the ball downhill\") will still work to train our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This version of the sigmoid model that takes multiple inputs is an example of a **neuron**."
