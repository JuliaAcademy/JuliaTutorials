    "In this notebook, we'll explore the importance of \"interpolating\" global variables when benchmarking functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We interpolate a global variable by throwing a `$` in front of it. For example, in `Julia is fast`, we benchmarked the `sum` function using `Vector` `A` via\n",

    "\n",
    "Call the `sum` function on a pseudo-randomly populated 1D array called `foo` of several lengths between 2 and 2^20 (~10^6). For each size of `foo`, determine the ratio of execution times for `sum(foo)` and `sum($foo)`. (To determine this ratio, use the minimum run times in each case.)\n",
    "\n",

    "## Performance tips -- type stability\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to optimize code in Julia is to ensure **type stability**. If the type(s) of some variables in a function are subject to change or ambiguity, the compiler cannot reason as well about those variables, and performance will take a hit. Conversely, we allow the compiler to optimize and generate more efficient machine code when we declare variables so that their types will be fixed throughout the function body.\n",

    "For example, let's say we had functions called `baz` and `bar` with the following definitions\n",

    "```julia\n",

    "    s = rand()\n",

    "    else\n",
    "        return 0    \n",
    "    end\n",
    "end\n",

    "@benchmark baz()\n",
    "@benchmark bar()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I see that `bar` is almost three times as fast as `baz`! The reason is that `bar` is type stable while `baz` is not: the compiler can tell that `bar` will always return a `Float`, whereas `baz` could return a `Float`, an `Int`, or a `Rational`. When the compiler can tell what the types of outputs from a function, or variables declared *within a function* are without running the code, it can do much better.\n",

    "Copy and execute the above code into a new cell. Benchmark it using `A = rand(10^3)`. Then write a new function called `my_sum2` with the same function body as `my_sum`. Update `my_sum2` to make it type stable, and benchmark it for a randomly populated array with 10^3 entries.\n",
