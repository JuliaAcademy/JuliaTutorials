What we need to do is incorporate more ideas into our model by allowing more inputs. However, more inputs would mean more parameters to play with. Also, we would like to have the computer start \"learning\" on its own, instead of modifying the parameters ourselves until we think it \"looks right\". How do we take the next step?\n",
