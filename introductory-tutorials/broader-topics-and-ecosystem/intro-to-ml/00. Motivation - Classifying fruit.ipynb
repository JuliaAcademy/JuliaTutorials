        "# Motivation\n\nHello, and welcome! We're excited to be your gateway into machine learning. ML is a rapidly growing field that's buzzing with opportunity. Why? Because the tools and skills employed by ML specialists are extremely powerful and allow them to draw conclusions from large data sets quickly and with relative ease. \n\nTake the Celeste project, for example. This is a project that took 178 **tera**bytes of data on the visible sky and used it to catalogue 188 millions stars and galaxies. \"Cataloguing\" these stars meant identifying characteristics like their locations, colors, sizes, and morphologies. This is an amazing feat, *especially* because this entire calculation took under 15 minutes.\n\n<img src=\"data/Celeste.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 1000px;\"/>\n\nHow are Celeste's calculations so fast? To achieve performance on this scale, the Celeste team uses the Julia programming language to write their software and supercomputers from Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's NERSC as their hardware. In this course, we unfortunately won't be able to give you access to a top 10 supercomputer, but we will teach you how to use Julia!\n\nWe're confident that this course will put you on your way to understanding many of the important concepts and \"buzz words\" in ML. To get you started, we'll teach you how to teach a machine to tell the difference between images of apples and bananas, i.e to **classify** images as being one or the other type of fruit.\n\nLike Project Celeste, we'll use the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) to do this. In particular, we'll be working in [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) like this one! (Perhaps you already know that the \"ju\" in Jupyter comes from Julia.)"

To do so, we will **train** the computer to learn **for itself** how to \ndistinguish the two images.\n\nThe following notebooks will walk you step by step through the underlying math and machine learning concepts you need to know in order to accomplish this classification.\n\nThey alternate between two different types of notebooks: those labelled **ML** (Machine Learning), which are designed to give a high-level overview of the concepts we need for machine learning, but which gloss over some of the technical details; and those labelled **Tools**, which dive into the details of coding in Julia that will be key to actually implement the machine learning algorithms ourselves.\n\nThe notebooks contain many **Exercises**. By doing these exercises in Julia, you will learn the basics of machine learning!"
